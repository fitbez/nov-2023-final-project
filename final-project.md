# Project Name: Book Finder

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a web application where users can search, view, create, update, and delete books.

## Requirements

### Setup & Initialization
- Create a new React project using Create React App.
- Set up a GitHub repository for your project.
- Install necessary dependencies like `axios` for making API requests and `react-router-dom` for routing.

### Designing the Application
- Create a wireframe or a mockup of your application using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or Canva.
- Your application should have at least two pages:
  - **List Page**
  - **Detail/Edit Page**

### API
- Use an API to fetch book data. You can use:
  - Google Books API
  - Open Library API
  - JSON placeholder API (for mock data)

### List Page
- Display a list of books.
- Each list item should minimally display the book title.
- Add a **Delete** button for each book, which should delete the book.
- Add an **Edit** button for each book, which should take the user to the Detail/Edit page.
- Add a **Create** button on this page, which should take the user to the Detail/Edit page where they can enter details for a new book.
- Add a search bar to filter through the books.

### Detail/Edit Page
- Display detailed information of a book.
- Allow the user to edit the book's details and save them.
- If the user came to this page by clicking the **Create** button, allow the user to enter details for a new book and save it.

### Routing
- Implement routing properly to navigate between pages.

### Deployment
- Deploy your application to Netlify or any hosting platform of your choice.

## Optional Advanced Requirements
- Add user authentication.
- Save user's favorite books and display them in a separate list.
- Add sorting functionality to the book list.

## Submission Guidelines
- Push the final code to your GitHub repository.
- Update the `README.md` file with details about the project, how to set up, install, and run it.
- Include the live URL of your hosted application in your repository description and `README.md`.

## Rubrics
- **Functionality**: Does the application do what was asked?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and reusable?
- **Design and Usability**: Is the application easy to understand and use?
- **Responsiveness**: Is the application viewable on all screen sizes?
- **Completion**: Is the application fully implemented and working?
